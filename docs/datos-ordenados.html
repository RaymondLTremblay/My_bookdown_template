<p><strong>Obtener los datos de observaciones de una especie en iNaturalist desde R:</strong></p>
<p>Los datos a utilizar se obtendrán desde iNaturalist, una aplicación con base en la ciencia ciudadana que mantiene un registro de ocurrencias de especies.</p>
<p>La función <code>get_inat_obs()</code> permite acceder a los datos disponibles en iNaturalist, especificando los siguientes parámetros:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>taxon_name</code>: La especies de interés, siempre escrita entre comillas (“). Puede utilizar nombre común o científico.</p></li>
<li><p><code>quality</code>: Siendo una aplicación basada en ciencia ciudadana, la calidad de algunos datos podría ser baja, debido a que les falta información - como nombre científico o ubicación - o que contienen información errónea - especies mal identificadas-. Colocando <code>'research'</code> en este parámetro se especifica que se desea obtener sólo aquellas observaciones con alta calidad - que tengan información completa y cuya identificación haya sido confirmada por varias personas de la comunidad -.</p></li>
<li><p><code>geo</code>: Al igual que el parámetro <code>quality</code>, este parámetro cuyo valor es lógico (<code>TRUE</code> o <code>FALSE</code>), es para especificar que se quiere obtener sólo los datos que están georeferenciados (cuando se coloca como <code>TRUE</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>maxresults</code>: A través del API (Interfaz de Programación de Aplicaciones) de iNaturalist se puede acceder a un máximo de 10,000 observaciones en una sola búsqueda. Con este parámetro, cuyo valor debe ser numérico, se especifica cuantas observaciones se desea obtener, y no se debe exceder de 10,000 por búsqueda.</p></li>
<li><p><code>bounds</code>: Un vector que contiene los límites geográficos de la búsqueda. Se puede insertar un cuadro delimitador ya especificado en un objeto, concatenar los valores del vector, o insertar un objeto de características simples (Simple Feature, sf). El argumento <code>bounds</code> es importante porque si obtenemos datos de iNaturalist, las únicas columnas que obtenemos con información acerca de la región o área donde se hicieron las observaciones son:<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><em>place_guess</em>: Contiene el nombre de la región, pero su precisión y los nombres utilizados para cada región varía mucho.</p></li>
<li><p><em>latitue</em>: Posición en el eje vertical del sistema de coordenadas.</p></li>
<li><p><em>longitude</em>: Posición en el eje horizontal del sistema de coordenadas.<br />
Esto crea un problema a la hora del filtrar los datos por el nombre de una región, pues es difícil encontrar un solo valor que encompase a todas las variantes del nombre utilizado para esa región. iNaturalist se encuentra a nivel mundial, y usted puede acceder a todos esos datos. Sin embargo, hoy accederemos solamente a datos de Puerto Rico. Entonces, lo primero antes de acceder a lo datos de iNaturalist, es crear un objeto que contenga los límites geográficos de interés crea. Para esto se crea un objeto que contenga un cuadro delimitador (<em>bounding box</em>):</p></li>

<p>Ahora podemos acceder a datos de Puerto Rico utilizando el objeto <code>cajapr</code>. Para este ejercicio utilizaremos datos de orquídeas pertenecientes al género <em>Eulophia</em>. En Puerto Rico se han reportado 3 especies de este género <em>Eulophia alta</em>, <em>Eulophia maculata</em> y <em>Eulophia graminea</em>. De estos, sólo <em>E. alta</em> es considerada nativa de la isla. Entonces, utilizando la función <code>get_inat_obs</code> podemos acceder a los datos de <em>Eulophia</em> en Puerto Rico</p>

<p>La función base del paquete leaflet es <code>leaflet()</code>, con esta se activa un artilugio (<em>widget</em> en inglés) sobre el cuál se construye el mapa. Esta función debe estar unida a otra función como <code>addTiles()</code> que añade el mapa.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb530"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb530-1"><a href="datos-ordenados.html#cb530-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">leaflet</span>() <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

<p>Una vez tenemos el artilugio y el mapa, añadimos una capa que incluye los datos que se desean visualizar con marcadores sobre el mapa con la función <code>addMarkers()</code> dentro del cual se deben especificar los parámetros <code>lng</code> (longitud) y <code>lat</code> (latitud). Note que también se especifica el data.frame que contiene los datos bajo la función <code>leaflet()</code>. Cuando se trabaja en Leaflet, al especificar las variables a utilizar, es necesario colocar una virgulilla (~) antes de la variable. Esto le deja saber a R que lo que se especifica es una variable dentro del data.frame mencionado en la primera capa bajo la función <code>leaflet()</code>.</p>

<p>Una vez los marcadores están establecidos, es posible añadir etiquetas que contengan información acerca de las observaciones con el parámetro <code>popup</code> de la función <code>addMarkers()</code>.

<p>La función <code>paste0</code> es una función base de R que concatena todos los elementos en una línea de caracteres. Los caracteres introducidos serán interpretados como UTF-8 o codificación de caracteres. Estos caracteres pueden ser mezclados con valores de una variable de caracteres en un data.frame. En el siguiente ejemplo se crea una etiqueta que contiene la ubicación y la especie observada. Se utiliza la función <code>paste0()</code> para combinar caracteres y las variables <em>scientific_name</em> y <em>place_guess</em> del data.frame.</p>

<p>La función <code>addAwesomeMarkers()</code> puede ser utilizada en lugar de <code>addMarkers()</code> y permite utilizar marcadores con diferentes diseños que se pueden obtener de <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&amp;p=1">fontawesome</a>. Es posible cambiar los colores de los marcadores utilizando la codificación de colores RGB en formato (#RRGGBB). La siguiente guía de colores en R creada por Melissa Clarkson (2010) explica como utilizar colores en R: <a href="https://bootstrappers.umassmed.edu/bootstrappers-courses/pastCourses/rCourse_2014-09/resources/helpfulGuides/Rcolorstyle.pdf">A guide to using color in R</a>. Adicional, esta <a href="https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/resources/colors">guía</a> creada por Derek H. Ogle (2022) es muy útil.</p>
<p>En <a href="https://www.schemecolor.com/github-cat-icon-colors.php">schemecolor</a> podemos encontrar las codificaciones de los colores y muchos funcionan para <code>leaflet</code>. Para hacer estos cambios utilizamos la función <code>awesomeIcons()</code> bajo el parámetro <code>icon</code> dentro de <code>addAwesomeMarkers()</code>.</p>
<p>Dentro de la función <code>awesomeIcons()</code> podemos especificar varios parámetros como:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>icon</code>: El icono que desea utilizar para su marcador. Debe poner el nombre que aparece en la página web de iconos que esté utilizando (<em>i.e.</em>, fontawesome).</p></li>
<li><p><code>library</code>: Cuando se especifica un icono, es necesario especificar la biblioteca de donde se saca el icono. Si es de fontawesome sería <code>'fa'</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>markerColor</code>: Para cambiar el color del marcador (parte que rodea el icono), utilizando la codificación de colores de schemecolor.</p></li>
<li><p><code>iconColor</code>: Para cambiar el color del icono del marcadora, también con la codificación de schemecolor.</p></li>

<p>Es posible distinguir entre especies utilizando diferentes colores, pero debe utilizar la función <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> en lugar de <code>addAwesomeMarkers()</code>. Para colorear grupos en Leaflet es necesario generar una paleta de colores para las variables de interés de acuerdo al tipo de variable (<em>i.e.</em>, numérica, factorial). Para esto se utilizan las funciones <code>colorFactor()</code>, <code>colorNumeric()</code>, <code>colorBin()</code>, o <code>colorQuantile()</code>. <code>colorFactor()</code> y <code>colorNumeric()</code> generan paletas de colores para variables factoriales y numericas, respectivamente; mientras que <code>colorBin()</code> y <code>colorQuantile()</code> generan paletas de colores para valores numéricos resumidos en grupos.</p>
<p>En este caso se está trabajando con una variable factorial que divide las observaciones entre 3 especies de orquídeas. Primero se crea una paleta de colores para una variable factorial con la función <code>colorFactor()</code>. Bajo esta función se especifican los parámetros <code>palette</code> y <code>levels</code>. <code>palette</code>es para especificar la paleta de colores a utilizar y <code>levels</code>especifica los niveles de la variable factorial. La paleta de colores que se utiliza (<code>"Dark2"</code>) proviene del paquete RColorBrewer. Esta paleta de colores para los niveles de la variable factorial <em>scientific_name</em> del data.frame <em>eulophia</em> se guardará en un objeto llamado <em>pal</em>.</p>

<p>Para ayudar con la visualización de datos pertenecientes a diferentes grupos, en ocasiones es bueno presentar una leyenda que indique los colores que representan cada grupo. Es posible añadir una leyenda al mapa de Leaflet utilizando la función <code>addLegend()</code> y especificando los siguientes parámetros:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>position</code>: Para determinar la posición de la leyenda, en este caso se colocará en la parte superior derecha, <code>"topright"</code>, del mapa, pero podría colocarla en la parte inferior derecha (<code>"bottomright"</code>), la parte inferior izquierda (<code>"bottomleft"</code>), o la parte superior izquierda (<code>"topleft"</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>pal: La paleta de colores a utilizar generada a través de la función <code>colorFactor()</code> o sus equivalentes (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>colorNumeric()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>values</code>: Los valores o la variable u objeto que contiene los valores utilizados.</p></li>
<li><p><code>title</code>: El título de la leyenda especificado como una línea de caracteres.</p></li>
</ul>
